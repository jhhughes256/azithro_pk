# Azithromycin Pharmacokinetic Simulations

This repository provides code for the web application described in the manuscript:

"Predictions of Systemic, Intracellular, and Lung Concentrations of Azithromycin with Different Dosing Regimens used in COVID-19 Clinical Trials" by Jim H. Hughes, Kevin Sweeney, Sima Ahadieh and Daniele Ouellet.

## Purpose of the Application

The application was developed for the simulation of azithromycin treatment regimens and comparison of model
predictions in plasma, peripheral leukocytes, lung and alveolar macrophages to effective concentratrions of azithromycin against COVID-19. 

This application is intended to aid dosing regimen selection for azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 conducted under the controlled environment of a registered clinical trial.

### Disclaimer

Azithromycin is not approved by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19. No recommendations are made for the treatment of COVID-19 with azithromycin outside of a registered clinical trial.

While this web application allows the comparison of in-vitro effective concentration values with tissue exposure, these values may not be indicative of effective concentrations in patients with COVID-19.

## Manuscript Code

The code within this repository also includes code used to produce the analyses and figures in the manuscript. This code describes:

- the data preparation for digitised data used in the manuscript
- the comparison of different models from literature and extension of these existing models
- the simulations conducted using the final model
- the sensitivity analyses conducted on the final model
